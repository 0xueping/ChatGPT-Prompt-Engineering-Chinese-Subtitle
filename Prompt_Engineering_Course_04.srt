1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,100
There's so much text in today's world, pretty much none of us have enough time to
在如今的世界，文字信息如此之多，我们几乎没有足够的时间

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,720
read all the things we wish we had time to.
阅读所有我们希望有时间阅读的所有内容。

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,860
So one of the most exciting applications I've seen of large language models is to use it
因此，我见过的大型语言模型最令人兴奋的应用之一就是将其用于

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,620
to summarize text.
对文本进行总结。

5
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,440
And this is something that I'm seeing multiple teams build into multiple software applications.
这是我看到的许多团队将其整合到多个软件应用中的功能。

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,840
You can do this in the ChatGPT web interface.
您可以在ChatGPT网络界面中执行此操作。

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,920
I do this all the time to summarize articles so I can just kind of read the content of
我一直在使用这个功能来总结文章，这样我就可以

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,880
many more articles than I previously could.
比我以前能阅读的更多文章的内容。

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,800
And if you want to do this more programmatically, you'll see how to in this lesson.
如果您想以更编程化的方式执行此操作，您将在本课中了解如何操作。

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,440
So that's let's dig into the code to see how you could use this yourself to summarize text.
那么让我们深入代码，看看您如何自己使用此功能来总结文本。

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,240
So let's start off with the same starter code as you saw before of import OpenAI,
那么让我们从之前看到的相同的起始代码开始，导入OpenAI，

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,560
load the API key and here's that get completion helper function.
加载API密钥，这里有一个获取补全的辅助函数。

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:00,560
I'm going to use as the running example, the task of summarizing this product review.
我将以总结这个产品评论为例来演示。

Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, who loves it and takes it everywhere,
我为女儿的生日买了这只熊猫毛绒玩具，她非常喜欢并且带着它到处去，

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,260
and so on and so on.
等等等等。

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:13,600
If you're building an e commerce website, and there's just a large volume of reviews,
如果您正在建立一个电子商务网站，并且有大量的评论，

17
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,600
having a tool to summarize the lengthy reviews could give you a way to
拥有一个可以总结冗长评论的工具可以让您

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,160
very quickly glance over more reviews to get a better sense of what all your customers are thinking.
快速浏览更多评论，更好地了解您的所有客户在想什么。

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,240
So here's a prompt for generating a summary.

20
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,560
Your task is generate a short summary of a product review from e commerce website, summarize
您的任务是从电子商务网站的产品评论中生成简短的摘要、总结

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,760

00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,640
And so this is soft and cute panda plush toy loved by daughter, but small for the price,
所以，这是一只受到女儿喜爱的柔软可爱的熊猫毛绒玩具，但价格有点小贵。

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
arrived early.
提前到货。

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Not bad.
还不错。

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
It's a pretty good summary.
这是一个相当好的总结。

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,680
And as you saw in the previous video, you can also play with things like
正如您在之前的视频中看到的，您还可以尝试

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,640
controlling the character count or the number of sentences to affect the length of this summary.
控制字符数量或句子数量以影响摘要的长度。

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,840
Now sometimes when creating a summary, if you have a very specific purpose in mind for
有时在创建摘要时，如果您心中有一个非常具体的目的，

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,520
the summary, for example, if you want to give feedback to the shipping department, you can
例如，如果您想向运输部门提供反馈，您可以

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,120
also modify the prompt to reflect that so that they can generate a summary that is more
修改提示以反映这一点，以便他们可以生成更

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,520
applicable to one particular group in your business.
适用于您业务中的某个特定群体。

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:26,800
So for example, if I add to give feedback to the shipping department, let's say I change
例如，如果我要向运输部门提供反馈，我们假设我修改这里

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:35,720
this to start to focus on any aspects that mention shipping and delivery of the product.
开始关注提到产品运输和交付的任何方面。

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,480
And if I run this, then again, you get a summary, but instead of starting off
如果我运行这个，那么您再次得到一个摘要，但是不是从

35
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,080
with soft and cute panda plush toy, it now focuses on the fact that it arrived a day earlier than expected.
柔软可爱的熊猫毛绒玩具开始，现在关注的是它比预期提前一天到达。

36
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,520
And then it still has other details.
它仍然有其他一些细节。

37
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:59,600
Or as another example, if we aren't trying to give feedback to the shipping department,
或者，作为另一个例子，如果我们不是要向运输部门提供反馈，

38
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:09,480
but let's say we want to give feedback to the pricing department.
但我们假设我们想要向定价部门提供反馈。

39
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,760
So the pricing department is responsible for determining the price of the product.
所以定价部门负责确定产品的价格。

40
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:25,200
And I'm going to tell it to focus on any aspects that are relevant to the price and perceived value.
我将告诉它关注与价格和感知相关的任何方面的价值

41
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,400
And this generates a different summary that it says, maybe the price may be too high for a size.
这会生成一个不同的摘要，可能对于尺寸来说价格过高，

42
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,600
Now in the summaries that I've generated for the shipping department or the pricing department,
现在，在我为运输部门或定价部门生成摘要，

43
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,360
it focuses a bit more on information relevant to those specific departments.
它更关注与这些特定部门相关的信息。

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,920
And in fact, feel free to pause the video now and maybe ask it to generate information
实际上，现在随时暂停视频，也许请它生成信息

45
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,280
for the product department responsible for the customer experience of the product or
关于负责产品的客户体验的产品部门或

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,840
for something else that you think might be interesting to an e-commerce site.
关于您认为对电子商务网站可能有趣的其他事物。

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,920
But in these summaries, even though it generated the information relevant to shipping, it had
但是，在这些摘要中，即使生成了与运输相关的信息，它还具有

48
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,160
some other information too, which you could decide may or may not be helpful.
一些其他信息，您可以决定是否有帮助。

49
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,920
So depending on how you want to summarize it, you can also ask it

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,900
to extract information rather than summarize it.
提取信息而不是总结它。

51
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,840
So here's a prompt that says you're tasked to extract relevant information

52
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,120
to give feedback to the shipping department.
向运输部门提供反馈

53
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,360
And now it just says, product arrived a day earlier than expected without all of the other
现在它只是说，产品比预期提前一天到达，而没有其他的

54
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,200
information, which was also helpful in a general summary, but less specific to the shipping
信息，这在总体摘要中也很有帮助，但对运输来说不太具体

55
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,600
department if all it wants to know is what happened with the shipping.
部门如果它只想知道运输发生了什么。

56
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,560
Lastly, let me just share with you a concrete example for how to use this in a workflow
最后，让我与您分享一个如何在工作流程中使用此功能的具体示例

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,720
to help summarize multiple reviews to make them easier to read.

this in detail?

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:41,520
So I'm going to set review one to be just the product review that we had up there.
所以我将把第一条评论设置为我们之前的产品评论。

70
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,240
And I'm going to put all of these reviews into a list.
然后我要把所有这些评论放到一个列表里。

71

87
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,840
inferences using text.
