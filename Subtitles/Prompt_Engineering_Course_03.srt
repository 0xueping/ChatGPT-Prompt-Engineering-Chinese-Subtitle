When I've been building applications with large language models,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,200
I don't think I've ever come to the prompt that I ended up
我不认为我在最终应用程序中使用的提示

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,520
using in the final application on my first attempt.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,120
And this isn't what matters.
这并不重要。

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,820
As long as you have a good process to iteratively make your prompt better,
只要您有一个不断改进提示的良好过程，

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,080
then you'll be able to come to something that

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,640
works well for the task you want to achieve.
很好地完成您想要实现的任务的东西。

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,960
You may have heard me say that when I create a machine learning model,

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,880
it almost never works the first time.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,320
In fact, I'm very surprised that the first model I trained works.
事实上，我对我训练的第一个模型能够工作感到非常惊讶。

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,720
I think we're prompting, the odds of it working the first time is
我认为我们在提示，它第一次工作的几率

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,600
maybe a little bit higher but as Isa was saying,
可能有点高，但正如Isa所说的那样，

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,040
doesn't matter if the first prompt works,
第一个提示是否有效并不重要，

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,040
what matters most is the process for

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,600
getting to the prompts that works for your application.
找到适用于您的应用程序的提示的过程。

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,480
So with that, let's jump into the code and let me show you
那么，让我们进入代码，让我向您展示

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,080
some frameworks to think about how to iteratively develop a prompt.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,200
So if you've taken a machine learning class with me before,

18
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,680
you may have seen me use a diagram saying that with machine learning development,
您可能看过我用一个图表表示，在机器学习开发中，

19
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,360
you often have an idea and then implement it.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,720
So write the code, get the data,

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,640
train your model, and that gives you an experimental result.

figure out where it's working or not working,

exactly what problem you want to solve or how to approach it.

not that important for the rest of this presentation.

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,040
gives the system time to think.

you can get it to focus more on specific characters,

152
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,120
I might decide at the end of the description,

157
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,880
And to get it to give me the product IDs,

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,280
include every seven character product ID in the technical specification.

162
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,480
shell colors, talks about plastic coating, aluminum base,

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,920
prompt development that many developers will go through.

Isa share a number of best practices.

170
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,600
And so what I usually do is keep best practices like that in mind,

be clear and specific, and if necessary,

172
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
give the model time to think.

173
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,840
With those in mind, it's worthwhile to often take a first attempt at writing a prompt,
牢记于心，经常编写提示时第一次尝试是值得的。

174
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,840
see what happens, and then go from there to iteratively refine the prompt to get

00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,480
closer and closer to the results that you need.

177
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,560
was arrived at at an iterative process like this.

give you a sense of what chat GPT can do,

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,840
After the description, include a table that gives the product dimensions,

182
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,160
and then you'll format everything as HTML.

185
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,720
really only after multiple iterations.

187
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,600
they were trying to get the system to process a fact sheet.

188
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,160
And so this actually outputs a bunch of HTML.

All right, looks like it rendered.

194
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,320
Construction, materials, product dimensions.

195
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,200
Oh, it looks like I left out the use at most 50 words instruction.
哦，看起来我遗漏了最多使用50个单词的指令。

196
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,680
So this is a little bit long, but if you want that, you can even--

197
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,920
feel free to pause the video.

200
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,640
is an iterative process.

to get it closer to delivering the results that you want.

207
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
about knowing the perfect prompt.

217
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,000
But then for more mature applications, sometimes it
